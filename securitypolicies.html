<h1>Security Policies</h1>

<li><strong>Access Control</strong></li>
<p>Access to company and customer systems, data, and resources is granted based on role-based permissions. Consultants and administrative staff have different access levels to ensure that only authorized personnel can view, modify, or share sensitive information. Employees must follow the principle of least privilege (PoLP)—only accessing the data and systems necessary for their work. Unauthorized sharing of credentials or granting access to unauthorized individuals is strictly prohibited.</p>
<li><strong>Password Management</strong></li>
<p>Strong password policies help protect systems from unauthorized access. Employees must create complex passwords that include a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters, numbers, and special characters. Passwords should not be reused across multiple accounts. The use of a password manager is recommended for secure storage. Additionally, two-factor authentication (2FA) must be enabled wherever possible to add an extra layer of security, reducing the risk of compromised accounts.</p>
<li><strong>Data Protection</strong></li>
<p>Sensitive company and customer information must be handled securely to prevent data leaks and breaches. Data must be stored on approved, encrypted storage solutions and shared only through secure channels. When dealing with customer data, consultants must adhere to the customer’s security policies and any applicable legal requirements, such as GDPR. Unauthorized data transfers, including sending company or customer files to personal email accounts or USB drives, are prohibited.</p>
<li><strong>Device Usage</strong></li>
<p>Employees use a mix of personal and customer-provided hardware. To reduce security risks, personal devices used for work must have up-to-date antivirus software, firewall protection, and disk encryption. Employees must avoid installing unapproved software and should immediately report lost or stolen devices to the security team. Customer-provided hardware should only be used for work related to that customer and must be handled according to their security guidelines.</p>
<li><strong>Cloud Service Usage</strong></li>
<p>The company utilizes a cloud service for communication, document sharing, and sometimes for prototyping small software solutions. Employees must follow strict access control rules, ensuring that only authorized personnel have permission to view or modify files. Sensitive documents should be stored in restricted-access folders, and public sharing links should be avoided unless absolutely necessary. When using the cloud service for prototyping, employees must ensure that customer data is not exposed or improperly stored.</p>
<li><strong>Remote Work Security</strong></li>
<p>Since consultants work from customer offices, the company office, home, or while traveling, they must follow best practices for remote work security. This includes using a Virtual Private Network (VPN) when accessing company or customer systems from public or untrusted networks. Employees must avoid using public Wi-Fi for work without a VPN and should never leave work devices unattended in public spaces. Physical security measures, such as locking screens when away from devices, should always be followed.</p>
<li><strong>Acceptable Usage Policy</strong></li>
<p>The acceptable use policy outlines what is allowed and restricted when using company and customer systems. Employees must not use work devices or accounts for personal activities, including social media, gaming, or unauthorized software installations. The use of company and customer resources for illegal activities, such as downloading copyrighted materials or accessing restricted websites, is strictly forbidden. Employees are expected to follow ethical IT practices and report any suspicious activities to the security team.</p>
