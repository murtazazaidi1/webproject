<h1>Help & Support</h1>

<li><strong>Getting Help with Security-Related Issues</strong></li>
<p>If you are unsure about how to handle a specific situation—such as a suspicious email, secure file transfer, or using a customer’s system—reach out as soon as possible.</p>
<p>Primary Contact for IT Security Support:</p>
<p>Name/Role: [Designated Security Contact or Manager]</p>
<p>Email: [security@yourcompany.com]</p>
<p>Phone/Chat: [Internal contact method or emergency number]</p>
<li><strong>Incident Reporting</strong></li>
<p>All security incidents must be reported immediately to ensure timely response and mitigation. This includes situations such as suspected data breaches, unauthorized access to systems or data, lost or stolen devices, phishing attempts, suspicious messages, or any misuse of credentials or shared access. Incidents can be reported using the incident report form available in the company’s internal cloud system, by directly emailing the designated security contact, or—if the matter is urgent—by calling the dedicated security phone number. Prompt reporting helps protect both company and customer assets and supports compliance with legal and contractual obligations.</p>
<li><strong>Support for Tools and Platforms</strong></li>
<p>If you need assistance using the cloud platform, working within customer environments, or handling secure communication tools, support is readily available through several channels. Internal documentation and guidelines, stored in the company’s cloud drive, offer step-by-step instructions for common tasks. Quick reference guides are also provided for frequently used platforms to help you work efficiently and securely. In addition, peer support is encouraged—consultants are welcome to share tips, best practices, and help each other troubleshoot issues as they arise.</p>
<li><strong>Security Awareness and Training</strong></li>
<p>To keep everyone up to date on security practices, the company holds short security awareness sessions on a quarterly basis. These sessions are designed to highlight current risks, reinforce best practices, and ensure all team members understand their responsibilities. Important updates and reminders are also communicated regularly through internal channels, helping to keep security top of mind in daily operations. Additionally, all staff are encouraged to participate in optional online security courses to further enhance their knowledge and stay informed about evolving threats and standards.</p>
