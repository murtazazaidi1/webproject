<h1><strong>Best Practices</strong></h1>
<l1>
    <li>Strong Authentication and Access Control</li>
    <p>It is important to make sure only the right people can access systems and data. Using strong passwords, multi-factor authentication, and role-based access control helps keep information safe. Limiting access to only what is needed reduces the risk of unauthorized entry</p>
    <li>Regular Software Update and Patch Management</li>
    <p>Keeping software and systems updated is key to security. Hackers often target old versions with known weaknesses. Regular updates and patches fix these issues and protect against cyber threats.</p>
    <li>Data Encryption and Secure Communication</li>
    <p>Data should be kept safe both when stored and when sent over networks. Encryption turns information into a secret code that only authorized users can read. Secure communication methods, like HTTPS and VPNs, help protect sensitive data from hackers.</p>
    <li>Network Security Measures</li>
    <p>A strong network protects against attacks. Firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure Wi-Fi settings help block unwanted access. Regular monitoring can detect and stop threats before they cause harm.</p>
    <li>Secure Development Practices</li>
    <p>Software should be built with security in mind. Developers should check for vulnerabilities and follow best practices to avoid common risks. Secure coding, regular testing, and code reviews help prevent attacks.</p>
    <li>Employee Awareness and Training</li>
    <p>People are often the weakest link in security. Regular training helps employees spot phishing emails, avoid weak passwords, and follow safe practices. A well-informed team reduces the risk of cyber threats</p>
    <li>Backup and Disaster Recovery</li>
    <p>Data loss can happen due to cyberattacks, hardware failure, or natural disasters. Regular backups ensure important files can be restored quickly. A disaster recovery plan helps businesses recover and keep running with minimal damage.</p>
